Certainly! Here's a basic list of the positives your project has, focusing on the datasets, data sources, and questions that can be answered:

### Datasets and Sources

1. Seismological data:

   - Format: miniSEED
   - Source: PRRC Lab in Socorro, New Mexico
   - Parsing tool: ObsPy (Python library)

2. CO2 data:
   - Includes: Tax credits and cost information
   - Source: EPA databases (online)

### Questions That Can Be Answered

1. Probability of seismic activity during CO2 sequestration
2. Chance of blowouts on oil wells
3. Business benefits of CO2 sequestration (quantified) Monetary and efficiency
4. Optimization of oil well utilization to reduce the need for new wells
5. Environmental impact of CO2 sequestration (atmospheric CO2 reduction)

### Project Strengths

1. Interdisciplinary approach combining geophysics, environmental science, economics, and data science
2. Real-world relevance addressing climate change mitigation
3. Potential for creating compelling visualizations and narratives
4. Alignment with industry interests and potential for practical applications
5. Technical challenges that promote skill development in Python and ObsPy
6. Potential for contributing to academic publications or informing policy decisions

This list highlights the core elements of your project, emphasizing the unique datasets, the variety of analysis directions, and the project's strengths in terms of interdisciplinary learning, real-world impact, and potential outcomes.
