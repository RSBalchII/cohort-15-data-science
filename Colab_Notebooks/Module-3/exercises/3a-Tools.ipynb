{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6KOiLj1SWVDq"},"source":["Complete as many of the following problems as possible. **BONUS**: Make the functions interactive.\n","\n","1. **Password Generator** - Create a function that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length with atleast one character, one number and one symbol. Example: ```password(5) -> 'arg5!'```\n","\n","2. **Email Slicer** - Create a function that takes as input an email address and returns a string that contains two items - the person's username and the domain name. Example: ```email_slicer('nevin@cnm.edu') -> ('nevin', 'cnm.edu')```\n","3. **Acronym Creator** - Create a function that takes as input a string and returns an acronym that contains the first letter of each word in that string. Example: ```acronym_creator(\"My name is Nevin\") -> \"MNIN\"```\n","\n","4. **Dice Roller** - Create a function that takes as input a positive integer `n`. This function should simulate the rolling of a `n`-sided die 1000 times. It should create a seaborn countplot of the distribution of die rolls.\n","\n","5. **Max of Three** - Create a function that takes as input three floats and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max() function! Example: ```max_of_three(5,10,3) -> 10```\n","\n","6. **Age Calculator** - Create a function that takes as input someone's age in years and prints their age in days, hours and minutes. Example: ```age_calculator(33) -> \"You are 12045 days old. You are 289080 hours old. You are 12592800 minutes old.\"```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"6QUI0X_zpKWz"},"outputs":[],"source":["import random \n","import string "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["MNIN\n"]}],"source":["def acronym_creator(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Create an acronym from the input text.\n","    \n","    Args:\n","        text (str): The input text to create an acronym from.\n","    \n","    Returns:\n","        str: The acronym created from the input text.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    words = text.split()\n","    acronym = ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in words)\n","    return acronym\n","\n","# Example usage\n","text = \"My name is Nevin\"\n","result = acronym_creator(text)\n","print(result)  # Output: MNIN"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Email Slicer Result: ('nevin', 'cnm.edu')\n","Acronym Creator Result: MNIN\n"]}],"source":["def email_slicer(email):\n","    try:\n","        username, domain = email.split('@')\n","        return username, domain\n","    except ValueError:\n","        return None, None\n","\n","# Test the functions\n","email = 'nevin@cnm.edu'\n","\n","email_result = email_slicer(email)\n","\n","print(f\"Email Slicer Result: {email_result}\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["3. **Acronym Creator** - Create a function that takes as input a string and returns an acronym that contains the first letter of each word in that string.
