# Project SQL
## Pick a dataset that interests you (or multiple data sets)



Use the Open Data Sets available from Google BigQuery. You can use your own Google account or Kaggle.



## Come up with questions about your data

* What sort of information is in this dataset?

* How many records are there?

* Have the number of bitcoin transactions increased year over year?

* Does New Mexico get more or less rain now than 20 years ago?

* How many different countries (states, counties, cities, etc) have records in this data set?





## Use SQL queries to pull specific information



Do NOT pull all the data and then filter using DataFrame methods etc. Make sure and use AT LEAST 13 of the 15 SQL options listed below. (You may have to get creative and come up with more questions to ask/answer.)
### Basic Queries

#### SELECT (with * and with column names)

#### WHERE

#### AND

#### OR

#### LIKE (with % or _ wildcard)

#### BETWEEN

#### LIMIT



### Sorting and Grouping

#### ORDER BY

#### DISTINCT

#### GROUP BY



### Aggregates

#### MAX

#### MIN

#### SUM

#### AVG

#### COUNT



## Make some plots



Make some cool plots to go with your data. Write SQL queries to get ONLY the information you need for each plot. (Don't pull ALL the data and then just plot a few columns.)



## EXTRA CREDIT:
#### Use a query that joins two tables.

#### Make a model to see if you can predict something

#### Come up with something else cool to do with your data
