## Project Overview

The project combines three unique datasets to address critical environmental and economic issues:

1. Seismological data in miniSEED format from the PRRC Lab in Socorro, New Mexico
2. CO2 data from EPA databases, including tax credits and cost information
3. injection and purchase data from companies also kept at PRRC lab in Socorro, New Mexico

### Key Objectives

1. Analyze seismic activity during CO2 sequestration
2. Quantify business benefits of CO2 sequestration
3. Optimize oil well utilization to reduce the need for new wells
4. Assess environmental impact of CO2 sequestration

### Data Analysis Process

1. Parse and process miniSEED data using Python ObsPy
2. Integrate seismic data with EPA CO2 data
3. Correlate seismic activity with CO2 injection data
4. Analyze injection and production data to determine CO2 usage and oil production
5. Compare CO2 capture data from power plants with injection data

### Key Insights

1. Seismic activity correlation: Identify if seismic events correlate with CO2 injection
2. CO2 sequestration effectiveness: Determine if injected CO2 remains sequestered
3. Economic benefits: Quantify tax credits and cost savings from CO2 sequestration
4. Environmental impact: Assess reduction in atmospheric CO2

### Technical Challenges

1. Processing large-scale seismic data in miniSEED format by reducing needed data to relevant parameters

- downhole seismic activity + surface seismic activity = seismic event to be extracted from the data base
- correlate these seismic events to co2 sequestition from injection + production data set = co2 caused seismic event

2. Integrating different data formats (miniSEED, EPA databases)
3. Developing advanced data processing skills using Python and ObsPy

### Potential Outcomes

1. Contribution to climate change mitigation research
2. Insights for optimizing CO2 sequestration processes
3. Economic analysis of CO2 sequestration benefits
4. Potential for publication and informing policy decisions

### Project Strengths

1. Interdisciplinary approach combining geophysics, environmental science, economics, and data science
2. Real-world relevance addressing climate change mitigation
3. Potential for creating compelling visualizations and narratives
4. Alignment with industry interests and potential for practical applications
5. Technical challenges that promote skill development in Python and ObsPy

### Next Steps

1. Continue with data analysis and visualization
2. Conduct further analysis to refine insights
3. Present findings to stakeholders and potential publishers
4. Consider potential collaborations with other institutions or companies
5. Seek feedback and consider potential publication options
