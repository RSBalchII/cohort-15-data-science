## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis can be used to understand the feeling or emotion tied to the text. The sentiment attribute in TextBlob will return two values:

1. The **polarity score** (a float between -1.0 and 1.0). -1 is negative, 1 is positive.

2. The **subjectivity** (a float between 0.0 and 1.0). 0 is very objective, while 1 is very subjective.
Sentiment analysis of multiple sentences
### Your Turn

Create three TextBlobs with the following sentiments:

1. Negative, subjective

2. Positive, objective

3. Neutral

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of splitting long strings of text into small pieces (tokens).
## Singular & Plural
## Stemming & Lemmatization
Stemming is the process of deleting prefixes and suffixes from a word, leaving on the word “stem”. Lemmatization is similar to stemming, but lemmatization is able to capture the underlying meaning of the word.
## WordNet
## Spelling ( correcting )
## Counting Words
### Your Turn

1. Create a TextBlob called `message` and set it equal to `Good morning, todayy is going to be a fantastic day!`.

2. Correct the spelling in your TextBlob and set it equal to a new variable called `message_sp`.

3. Find the index of the word `fantastic`.

4. Look up the definition of the word `fantastic`.

5. Stem and lemmatize the word `fantastic`.
## TextBlobs as Strings

TextBlobs act as strings, meaning you can use all of the normal string methods and you can index them as you would a string.
