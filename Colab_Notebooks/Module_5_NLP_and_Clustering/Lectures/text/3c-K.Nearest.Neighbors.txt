### Gary Example

Fit nearest neighbors

Get nearest neighbors distances

Get people matching index

Vote
Repeat with K = all rows
Display vote for various values of K $\epsilon$ { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }
# NLP
If our text data are unlabelled (as is often the case in NLP), we can use KNN to identify documents that are similar to a given document.  In this example, our documents will be sentences and the given document will be the first sentence.
# Data Cleaning

We want to singularize guitarists and students.
## Bag of Words Using CountVectorizer
Perform the count transformation

## TF-IDF using BoW

Perform the TF-IDF transformation

Print out results in a dataframe

> Note: Converting a sparse matrix to a data frame is NOT something you will normally do, especially for large matrices.
## K Nearest Neighbors
Fit nearest neighbors

Create the reference matrix from the tf_idf matrix

Or ...



Create the reference matrix from the data frame

Get nearest neighbors distances

Pull out the original sentences given the indices.
# Another Example - Using Wikipedia API
## Get text and clean
Install Wikipedia API
Pull out page from Wikipedia

Replace newline chars with spaces before doing any processing. Strip the ' and "s" from possessives.

Convert to textblob
Only look at first 5 sentences

Singularize and convert back to string

## TF-IDF without using BoW
Perform the TF-IDF Vectorization

Print out results in a data frame

## K Nearest Neighbors
Fit nearest neighbors

Get nearest neighbors distances to first sentence
