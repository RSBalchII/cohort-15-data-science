# Writing to a File
## Using the Shell
Using echo and the shell's redirect operator.
Using a "here document" structure.
## Using writefile Magic
The `%%writefile` magic takes all the text after the magic and writes it to the specified file.
## Using Python
The most "Pythonic" way to write to a file is to use a "context manager".  The `with` command creates a code block that automatically handles, i.e. provides a context for, closing a file.
Another way to to use the pair `open` and `close`.  This is generally avoided as it is easy to forget to include the `close`.
# Reading from a File
## Using the Shell
The most common way to read from a file is to use `cat` and assign it to a Python variable.  Each line becomes an entry in a list.
## Using capture Magic
The `%%capture` magic reads all the output of a cell.  If a variable is given, the output is assigned to the variable.  Both the standard output and standard error are captured and can be accessed using the `#.stdout` and `#.stderr` attributes.  They are both strings.

## Using Python
Just the like writing, the most "Pythonic" way to read from a file is to use a "context manager".
You can also read one line at a time using a loop.
# Your turn
## Part 1

Write some content to files using each of the three methods shown above

- shell

- %%writefile

- Python open()



## Part 2

Then use each of the three methods shown above to read the content into a Python variable.

- shell

- %%capture

- Python open()

!echo hello world > hello.world.v01.txt

ls -la hello.world.v01.txt

!cat -n hello.world.v01.txt

%%bash

cat <<'asdfasdfasdf' > hello.world.v02.txt

  hello

  world

!cat -n hello.world.v02.txt

%%writefile hello.world.v03.txt

hello

with open("hello.world.v04.txt", "r") as file:

  output = file.read()



print(output)
type(output)
type(output.split('\n'))
output.split('\n')
!seq 1 10 > hello.world.v04.txt
!cat -n hello.world.v04.txt
output = ''

with open("hello.world.v04.txt", "r") as file:

  for line in file:

    output += line



print(output)
output
output = []

with open("hello.world.v04.txt", "r") as file:

  for line in file:

    output += [line.rstrip()]



print(output)
