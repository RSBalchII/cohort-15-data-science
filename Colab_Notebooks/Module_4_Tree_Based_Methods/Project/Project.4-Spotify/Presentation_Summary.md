# Presentation Format Outlining Music Popularity Prediction Findings

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

Begin by introducing the project's objective: predicting the popularity of songs on Spotify's Top 200 Weekly (Global) charts for 2020 & 2021. State the significance of this problem, potentially relating it to the music industry's interest in understanding factors driving song success.

### Hypothesis

Clearly articulate your initial hypothesis regarding the factors influencing song popularity. This sets the stage for the subsequent analysis and results.

## 2. Data and Methodology

### Data Source

Describe the dataset used, specifying its source (DDC Data Science) and the timeframe it covers (2020 & 2021).

### Features

Present the features considered in the models, categorizing them into audio features, artist popularity metrics, chart performance metrics, and other relevant characteristics.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Briefly explain the data cleaning steps undertaken, particularly noting the initial removal of specific numerical columns (in one project) and the rationale behind this decision.

### Data Scaling

Highlight the two scaling techniques used (standard scaling and min-max scaling) and their purpose in preparing the data for model training.

### Models

Introduce the four regression models employed: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

### Model Evaluation

Define the metrics used to assess model performance, specifically RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score. Explain their significance in evaluating the models' accuracy and predictive power.

## 3. Results

### Model Performance Comparison

Showcase the model comparison tables generated in both projects, visually comparing the performance of each model under standard and min-max scaling.

### Impact of Retained Numerical Columns

Emphasize the significant accuracy improvement observed when retaining the numerical columns ("Highest Charting Position," "Number of Times Charted," and "Artist Followers"). Clearly demonstrate the impact of this decision by contrasting the results from both projects.

### Feature Importance

Present the feature importance plots for each model and scaling type, highlighting the key features driving prediction. Focus on the dominance of "Artist Followers" after the numerical columns are retained and the consistent importance of "Loudness".

### Visualizations

Utilize scatter plots to visually represent the actual vs. predicted popularity for each model under both scaling methods. This aids in understanding the models' predictive accuracy.

## 4. Discussion and Conclusion

### Key Findings

Summarize the primary insights derived from the modeling results.

### Implications

Discuss the implications of the findings for the music industry, potentially addressing how artists and streaming platforms can leverage these insights.

### Limitations

Acknowledge the limitations of the study, such as the specific timeframe of the data, potential biases in the dataset, and the exclusion of certain features (like lyrics and social media trends).

### Future Work

Suggest areas for future research and improvement. This could include exploring alternative models, hyperparameter tuning, more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, or expanding the dataset with additional features.

## 5. Q&A

Allocate time for questions from the audience, encouraging engagement and further discussion.

Throughout the presentation, it's crucial to use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon where possible. Visual aids like charts, graphs, and key takeaways should be incorporated to enhance understanding and engagement.
