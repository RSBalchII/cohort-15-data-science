I recommend the following steps:

1 - read through the completed example notebook
2 - replicate the notebook, starting with the blank notebook and using the completed example as a guide
3 - repeat step 2 a few times until you feel you have a good understanding of how to do the project
4 - replicate the notebook, starting with the blank notebook and without looking at the completed example
