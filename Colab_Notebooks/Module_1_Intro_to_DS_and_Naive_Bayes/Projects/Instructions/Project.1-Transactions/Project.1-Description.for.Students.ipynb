One very important subset of performing data science on transaction data consists of binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?\n","\n","In this project, we want to predict whether or not a future customer will make a transaction based on their transaction data.\n","\n","The data provided has the same structure as real data typically available to solve this problem. The columns of the input variables have been anonymized, so there is no intuition available to help judge which variables might be more important, so all variables need to be considered equally.\n","\n","The project should be done using the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification techniques as covered in class.
