Based on a summary of how we should proceed with the Music Popularity Prediction project:

### Project Overview

The goal is to predict the popularity of songs using tree-based regression models trained on features collected from songs on Spotify's Top 200 Weekly (Global) charts in 2020 & 2021.

### Key Objectives

1. Minimize cross-validated root mean squared error (RMSE) when predicting song popularity.
2. Determine the importance of features in driving the regression result.

### Approach

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**

   - Load the data from the provided CSV file.
   - Examine the data structure, including column types and missing values.
   - Clean and preprocess the data as needed.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**

   - Identify the target variable (popularity or another appropriate indicator).
   - Select relevant features that would be available for new songs.
   - Consider creating new features through engineering if necessary.

3. **Data Split**

   - Split the data into training and test sets.

4. **Modeling**

   - Implement tree-based regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Use RFE and RFECV for feature selection.
   - Perform cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

5. **Evaluation and Analysis**

   - Calculate and report cross-validated RMSE.
   - Analyze feature importance.
   - Visualize results and insights.

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the entire data science process in a Jupyter notebook.

### Specific Steps

1. Load the data and perform initial exploratory data analysis.
2. Determine the appropriate target variable (popularity or another indicator).
3. Select and engineer features relevant for predicting new song popularity.
4. Split the data into training and test sets.
5. Implement and evaluate tree-based regression models:
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
6. Apply RFE and RFECV for feature selection.
7. Perform cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
8. Calculate and report cross-validated RMSE.
9. Analyze feature importance.
10. Visualize results and insights.
11. Document the entire process in a Jupyter notebook.

### Considerations

- Be mindful of overfitting and use techniques like regularization if necessary.
- Consider the interpretability of the model and its features.
- Ensure that the selected features would be available for new songs.
- Use appropriate data visualization techniques to communicate findings.

By following this approach, we'll be able to develop a robust model for predicting song popularity while addressing the challenges of selecting appropriate features and avoiding overfitting.
