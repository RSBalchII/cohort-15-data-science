The deep learning process is a huge leap forward in data science and the field is less than 15 years old. The processing is significantly different from our previous projects so you will basically be provided a walkthrough document delineating the steps - much like Project 1. Deep learning is fascinating and I just want you to go through the process so you can appreciate its power.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aO3HLTWdzq3V"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The data collection portion of deep learning projects is a rather complex task.
