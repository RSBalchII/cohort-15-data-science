Based on the information provided, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the summary and explanation of why these systems were created:

### Purpose and Creation of CAMPD and ECMPS 2.0

1. The Clean Air Markets Program Data (CAMPD) and Environmental Compliance and Monitoring Program System (ECMPS) 2.0 Beta Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) were created as part of the EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAPD) re-engineering effort.

2. The primary goals of this re-engineering effort are:

   - To provide better system usability, reliability, and security
   - To offer new functionality to users through modern interfaces and technologies
   - To consolidate and streamline existing systems

3. CAMPD replaced the older Air Markets Program Data (AMPD) tool in June 2022, offering improved access to data on allowances, compliance, emissions, and facility attributes.

4. ECMPS 2.0 is a new web-based version of the Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System, replacing the older desktop application.

### Key Features and Improvements

1. CAMPD:

   - Provides a more intuitive and streamlined interface for downloading power sector emissions, allowance, compliance, and facility data
   - Offers new functionality like a gallery of interactive tools and REST APIs
   - Maintains critical functionalities from AMPD, including a custom query tool and access to prepackaged datasets

2. ECMPS 2.0:
   - Allows facilities to review, edit, evaluate, and submit their monitoring plan, test data, and emissions data through a web-based interface
   - Eliminates the need for users to install and update desktop software
   - Changes the data reporting file format from XML to JSON

### Tax Credit System Data Calculation and Storage

While the provided information doesn't explicitly detail how tax credit data is calculated and stored, we can infer some aspects:

1. The tax credit system likely relies on data collected through ECMPS and analyzed in CAMPD.

2. Calculations probably involve factors such as:

   - Emissions reductions achieved by facilities
   - Participation in allowance trading programs
   - Compliance with regulations

3. Data storage:
   - Raw data is likely stored in databases associated with ECMPS
   - Processed and aggregated data for tax credits would be maintained in CAMPD
   - Both systems use secure, EPA-managed servers to protect sensitive information

### API Functionality

1. The Clean Air Markets Application Programming Interface (CAM API) allows developers to access Clean Air Markets Program data directly in their preferred programming languages.

2. The API follows REST principles and is documented using the Open API Specification, allowing both humans and machines to understand how to use the available services.

3. Users can request an API key to authenticate their requests and access the data programmatically.

### Conclusion

These systems were created to modernize the EPA's approach to collecting, managing, and disseminating environmental data. By providing more accessible and flexible tools, the EPA aims to enhance transparency, facilitate analysis, and support decision-making in the clean air markets sector. The shift towards web-based solutions and standardized APIs reflects a broader trend in government data management towards openness and interoperability.
